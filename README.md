## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

> **📖 Full Docker reference:** [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) — building locally, clean runs, environment variables, terminal options
>
> **📖 Manual setup (no Docker):** [docs/MANUAL_SETUP.md](docs/MANUAL_SETUP.md) — Python venv, individual component commands, run scripts

### 1. Clone and Get Data

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IvanYachUkr/Pulse.git
cd Pulse
```

Place a **date-sorted** Parquet file from the [Amazon Redset](https://github.com/amazon-science/redset) dataset at:

```
kafka_stream/data/sorted_4days.parquet
```

### 2. Start

```bash
docker compose up
```

This pulls the pre-built image, starts Kafka, and runs the entire pipeline. Wait 30–60 seconds for data to flow, then open the dashboard.

### 3. Access

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **Dashboard** | [http://localhost:8507](http://localhost:8507) |
| **Kafka Console** | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) |

### 4. Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

> **⚠️ Important:** Close the dashboard browser tab **before** restarting the pipeline from scratch. An open dashboard holds connections to SQLite/DuckDB databases inside the container, which can prevent proper cleanup on restart.

## 🎯 Overview

This pipeline processes query events from Kafka, detects outliers using ONNX models, and automatically retrains models daily. Optimized for high throughput with Apache Arrow Feather format achieving **47x faster writes** than Parquet.

### Data Flow

```
Kafka → Consumer → Feather Writer → Daily Files (.arrow)
                 ↓
              Inference (ONNX)
                 ↓
           Anomaly Detection
                 
Daily Files → Async Training (subprocess) → New Models → Next Day Inference
```

### Key Features

* **Real-time inference:** Batch inference with ONNX runtime
* **Asynchronous training:** Non-blocking model retraining in subprocess (~90s average)
* **High performance:** 17,700 msg/s throughput (300x+ real-time capacity)
* **Optimized storage:** Apache Arrow Feather format (47x faster writes than Parquet-gzip)
* **Compression options:** LZ4 (maximum speed) or ZSTD (2x better compression)
* **Fast JSON parsing:** orjson (3.6x faster than stdlib)

## 📊 Query Classification

Every query is classified into one of five categories based on its performance bottleneck:

| Class | What It Captures | Key Threshold |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Network-bound** | COPY/UNLOAD data transfers | exec > 500ms |
| **CPU-bound** | Complex compute-heavy queries | exec/scan ratio > 20, exec > 1s |
| **IO-bound** | Large scans bottlenecked by disk | scan ≥ 2 GB, ratio < 0.061 |
| **Queue/WLM-bound** | Simple queries stuck waiting | queue ≥ exec, complexity < 4 |
| **Normal** | No dominant bottleneck | Everything else |

All thresholds are **data-derived** from behavioral regime analysis of 433M queries — not hardcoded assumptions. See **[QUERY_CLASSIFICATION.md](docs/QUERY_CLASSIFICATION.md)** for the full methodology, transition points, and validation results.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Architecture

The dashboard is a **decoupled SPA** built with a **FastAPI JSON backend** and a **Preact + HTM** client — no build tools, no bundler, no `node_modules`.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Backend** | FastAPI + Uvicorn | JSON API serving dashboard data from SQLite/DuckDB |
| **Frontend** | Preact + HTM (via CDN) | Reactive UI with hooks, delivered as a single HTML file |
| **Charts** | Chart.js (via CDN) | Interactive time-series and classification charts |
| **Styling** | Vanilla CSS (custom) | Dark-mode glassmorphism design with CSS variables |

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/status` | GET | Pipeline component health status |
| `/api/instances` | GET | Available cluster instance IDs |
| `/api/instances/critical` | GET | Instances flagged as critical |
| `/api/metrics?ids=...` | GET | Aggregated performance metrics |
| `/api/classification/chart?ids=...` | GET | Query classification time-series |
| `/api/classification/table?ids=...` | GET | Query classification breakdown |
| `/api/anomalies?ids=...` | GET | Detected anomalous queries |
| `/api/critical/types?ids=...` | GET | Critical problem type distribution |
| `/api/recommendations/{type}` | GET | Auto-generated remediation advice |

### Key Features

* **Multi-instance selection** — Select/deselect individual instances, use "Select All" / "Critical Only" shortcuts
* **Time window toggle** — Switch between 24h and 1-week views
* **Real-time status indicators** — Live health checks for stream analytics, anomaly detection, and database
* **Metric cards** — Score, queue time, spillage, anomaly count with trend indicators
* **Interactive charts** — Stacked area chart for query classification over time
* **Anomaly table** — Detected anomalous queries with severity highlighting
* **Recommendations panel** — Context-aware remediation advice based on dominant problem types

## 📊 Performance

### Overall Pipeline

| Component | Throughput | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Producer** | 31-38k msg/s | Consistent performance |
| **Consumer (with inference)** | 17,700 msg/s | 4 workers, batch 65k |
| **Consumer (write only)** | 21,600 msg/s | Excluding inference |
| **Training** | ~90s/day | 400k rows per day (async) |

**Real-time capacity:** ~36 msg/s (300x+ speedup exceeds requirements)

### Inference Parallelization Benchmark (600k messages)

| Workers | CPU Throughput | GPU Throughput |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **1** | 11,739 msg/s | 10,229 msg/s |
| **4** | **12,864 msg/s** ⭐ | 11,248 msg/s |
| **8** | 12,724 msg/s | — |

**Recommendation:** Use `--inference-workers 4` for optimal performance (CPU).

> ⚠️ **GPU Note:** Tested with RTX 4070. GPU is **SLOWER** than CPU for this workload! The ONNX Isolation Forest model requires CPU↔GPU data transfers (memcpy) that negate any compute gains. Use CPU.

## 🔧 Design Decisions & Benchmarks

### Apache Arrow Feather Format (47x Faster Writes)

| Format | Write Speed | Read Speed | File Size |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Parquet (gzip) | 1x (baseline) | **5x faster** | **Smallest** |
| **Feather (LZ4)** | **47x faster** | 1x | 7x larger |

**Writes happen in the main consumer loop** (directly impacts throughput). **Reads happen asynchronously** in a subprocess. Therefore, write speed is critical.

### Compression Options (LZ4 vs ZSTD)

| Compression | Write Speed | File Size | Use Case |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **LZ4** (default) | Fastest | Larger (2.3x ratio) | Real-time streaming |
| **ZSTD** | 40% slower | **2x smaller** (5.6x ratio) | Disk-constrained, archival |

### JSON Parsing with orjson (3.6x Faster)

| Library | Speed | Improvement |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| json (stdlib) | 1x (baseline) | - |
| **orjson** | **3.6x faster** | 260% faster |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Training Fails
* Check `training_logs/train_*.log` for errors
* Verify arrow files are readable: `import pyarrow.feather as feather; feather.read_feather("path")`
* Ensure training has enough data (at least N days configured)

### Low Throughput
* Use LZ4 compression (not ZSTD) for maximum write speed
* Check inference batch size (65k optimal)
* Run multiple consumer instances on partitioned topic
* Verify orjson is installed for fast JSON parsing

### Out of Memory
* Reduce inference batch size
* Reduce writer batch size
* Reduce Kafka buffer sizes
